          <h3>IEEE</h3>
          <p>
            IEEE is the world’s largest professional association dedicated to
            advancing technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of
            humanity. IEEE MSIT is a Student Branch of IEEE, established in the
            year 2009 to edify technical skills in a dexterous manner among the
            students of MSIT. The main objective laid down at the very beginning
            was to promote IEEE amongst the students. IEEE MSIT with its aim of
            “leading the wave of change” aspires to achieve excellence in all
            its endeavours. The Student Branch is committed to helping young
            undergraduates evaluate their career goals, polish their technical
            skillset, and create the building blocks of a lifelong and diverse
            professional network by providing them a plethora of opportunities.
            IEEE MSIT has been significant in organizing workshops, short term
            project initiatives, scientific excursions, lecture series, and
            competitions since its beginning. IEEE MSIT has conducted many
            hands-on workshops on Robotics, Arduino, Web development, and
            Android amongst others. It has launched the Short Term Project
            Initiative where students from 1st and 2nd-year work with the 3rd
            and 4th-year students in various traditional and emerging fields of
            technologies for 2 months to gain practical knowledge in their area
            of interest. The flagship event of IEEE MSIT, “Technical Project
            Exhibition” has been extremely successful for the past four years
            and counting. We have had the honor of hosting eminent speakers and
            guests such as Dr.KiranBedi, the first women IPS officer, Mr. Bharat
            Sethi, founder of postergully.com, and Ms.RashmiAnand, famous author
            and domestic violence survivor who works with the Delhi Police Crime
            against Women Cell. To promote specialized education and awareness
            amongst the students, IEEE MSIT has 3 Chapters under it- the
            Computer Society (CS), the Power and Energy Society (PES), and the
            Robotics and Automation Society (RAS). It also has an affinity group
            called Women in Engineering (WiE). Computer Society is the premier
            source for information and collaboration in computer science and its
            vision is advancing in theory, practice, and application. It has
            organized workshops and seminars on Data mining, Networking, Web
            Development, and Augmented reality. Power and Energy Society is one
            of the oldest societies mainly focused to become a leading provider
            of scientific and engineering information on electrical power and
            energy. It organizes various seminars and workshops which give
            students a chance to work on their ideas and explore. It had
            successfully organized the October Projects Week in the year 2015
            where students were mentored by their seniors and worked on projects
            like door lock system, solar power lightening, and multimeter using
            Arduino. Robotics and Automation Society aims to facilitate the
            exchange of scientific knowledge in the Robotics field. It has
            organized workshops and seminars on Antenna Fabrication, Quiz on
            Electromagnetism, BOT making workshops, webinar on robotics and
            automation, and Arduino workshops. Women in Engineering is an
            affinity group dedicated to promote women engineers. As part of STAR
            (Students, Teachers, and Research), IEEE MSIT WiE has organized
            interactive sessions in schools to impart knowledge about
            engineering to inspire young children, especially girls, to join it.
            It has also organized a Breast Cancer Awareness session and Self
            Defence workshops. To make the benefits of IEEE accessible to
            maximum student members, IEEE MSIT believes in the concept of
            Special Interest Groups (SIGs). The 13 SIGs aim at providing an
            avenue to people with similar interests, enabling them to come
            together, explore their fields of interest, and learn together.
            Various Special Interest Groups managed by IEEE MSIT are Deep
            learning, Machine learning using python, Cyber Security, Android,
            IoT using Raspberry Pi, Embedded system, Designing and Video editing
            to name a few, which provide a practical edge to the students in an
            artful manner. Our student members have represented IEEE MSIT
            Student Branch at various National and International platforms like
            the IEEE European Microwave Conference held in Paris, France, R10
            (Asia Pacific) Student- WIE- YP Congress 2015, and All India Student
            Congress. One of our members, Mr.YashrajGarg attended the Writing
            Sessions Meeting organised by IEEE Standards Association in Germany
            during October, 2019, which was fully funded by IEEE. IEEE MSIT won
            the prestigious Darrel Chong Student Activity Award in 2013 and 2015
            for organizing laudable and value-driven student activities.
